<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is a Sun photometer?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

A Sun photometer (or sunphotometer) is a kind of light meter that

measures the light from the Sun. Most Sun photometers measure

sunlight at discrete colors or wavelengths. All Sun photometers

measure only the sunlight arriving directly from the Sun and not

the sunlight scattered from MOLECULES and AEROSOLS (or particles)

in the sky. Therefore a Sun photometer must be pointed directly

at the Sun.   

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatmeasure">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What does a Sun photometer measure?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

A SUN PHOTOMETER measures the sunlight in a narrow spectral band

that passes through the Earth's atmosphere. If the

EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONSTANT for a particular Sun photometer is

known, a Sun photometer can measures the transmission (T) of

sunlight through the atmosphere. The clearer the sky, the higher

the transmission of sunlight. AEROSOLS such as smoke and dust

absorb or scatter sunlight. Therefore, aerosols reduce the

sunlight transmitted through the atmosphere.

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatvalue">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>Of what value are measurements made with a Sun photometer?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Sun photometers are ideal for monitoring natural haze and air

pollution. The transmission of sunlight through the atmosphere

(T) or the optical thickness (or optical depth) of the

atmosphere. T is slightly reduced (and optical thickness slightly

increased) when sunlight is scattered from molecules of air. T is

also reduced by natural haze and air pollution. Natural haze can

be caused by water vapor, natural forest and brush fires, dust,

pollen, gases emitted by plants and trees, sea salt and volcanic

eruptions. Air pollution is a byproduct of automobile emissions,

coal-burning power plants, intentional burning of forests and

rangelands, certain industrial and mining operations and dust

from unpaved roads and agricultural fields.

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>



<P>

Some Sun photometers measure the amount of certain gases in the

atmosphere. This is done by measuring the T (or optical

thickness) at two different wavelengths, one of which is strongly

absorbed by the gas being measured and the other which is not.

The ratio of the two measurements is then used to determine how

much of the absorbing gas is in a column through the atmosphere.

This method is often used to measure ozone and water vapor.

<A NAME="whatextra">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is the extraterrestrial constant?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

The extraterrestrial constant is the total amount of sunlight

arriving at the top of the atmosphere. The extraterrestrial

constant  is often represented as Io in Sun photometer formulas.

A Sun photometer at the top of the atmosphere would not need to

observe the Sun with a narrow FIELD OF VIEW since outside the

atmosphere there are no air molecules or aerosols to scatter

sunlight. Since Sun photometers usually measure discrete colors

or wavelengths of sunlight, the extraterrestrial constant they

measure is that of the specific color or wavelength and not all

the light emitted by the Sun. You can use the LANGLEY METHOD to

measure the extraterrestrial constant for a Sun photometer such

as the VHS-1.

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatfield">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is field of view?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

The field of view is the solid angle of the sky viewed by a Sun

photometer. A field of view (or FOV) of 2 degrees means that the

instrument is observing a circular segment of the sky which

subtends an angle of 2 degrees. The Sun subtends an angle of

approximately half a degree.  

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatlangley">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is the Langley method?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Samuel Langley pioneered the measurement of sunlight for the

Smithsonian Institution. He used BEER'S LAW to measure the

EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONSTANT of sunlight at the top of the

atmosphere without leaving the surface of Earth. Though the

method is very simple, it gives surprisingly accurate results.

Therefore, it has been used by atmospheric scientists for more

than a century. Briefly, the Langley method requires that you

make measurements of direct sunlight with a Sun photometer for

half of a very clear day. You then make a graph which plots the

natural logarithm (ln) of your measurements (on the y or upright

axis) against the AIR MASS (on the x or horizontal axis) during

each measurement. If the day was clear and you pointed the

instrument directly at the Sun, the data points plotted on the

graph will fall along or very near a perfectly straight line.

Extending this line to where it crosses the y axis at an AIR MASS

of 0 will give the ln of the extraterrestrial constant for the

instrument. <A HREF="101.html">See the VHS-1 manual</A> for details about using your

computer to compute the linear regression of your data to arrive

at the extraterrestrial constant.

<A NAME="whatbeer">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is Beer's Law?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

August Beer was a German physicist who lived from 1825 to 1863.

Beer's specialty was optics. He developed the principle known as

Beer's Law, which explains how the intensity of a beam of light

is reduced as it passes through different thicknesses of a

medium. A simplified version of Beer's Law that gives the OPTICAL

THICKNESS of the atmosphere measured by a Sun photometer is the

natural logarithm (ln) of the instrument's EXTRATERRESTRIAL

CONSTANT (Io) minus the ln of the intensity of sunlight measured

by the instrument divided by the AIR MASS. (See the VHS-1

INSTRUCTIONS for the complete formula.) 

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatot">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is optical thickness?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Optical thickness or optical depth describes how much light

passes through a material. Since the amount of light that passes

through a material can be quite small (less than a fraction of

1%) or very large (nearly 100%), optical thickness is based on a

logarithmic scale. There are various definitions. When the

optical thickness of the atmosphere is measured, the usual

definition is that the optical thickness is -ln T, where T is the

transmission of the atmosphere. If T is 0.95, then the optical

thickness is 0.05. The optical thickness of the atmosphere is

higher than in space because of Rayleigh scattering and MIE

SCATTERING.  

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatam">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is air mass (m)?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Air mass (m) is the thickness of atmosphere through which a beam

of sunlight travels. At any sea level location, the air mass is 1

when the Sun is straight overhead at solar noon. A simplified

formula for air mass is m = 1/sine of the Sun's angle over the

horizon. Therefore, when the Sun is 30 degrees over the horizon,

m = 2 (1/0.5). A more refined version of this basic equation

which accounts for the curvature of the Earth is used in the VHS-1 spreadsheet. 

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatrs">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is Rayleigh scattering?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Molecules of air scatter sunlight. Air molecules scatter

ultraviolet and blue wavelengths much more efficiently than red

and infrared wavelengths. You can easily observe Rayleigh

scattering. Shine a bright flashlight or, even better, a red

laser beam, through a dark room. The uniform glow you see that

outlines the beam of light is caused by Rayleigh scattering.

Bright speckles in the beam are caused by AEROSOLS (usually

particles of dust) in the air. Light scattered from aerosols is

caused by MIE SCATTERING. Caution: If you use a laser for this

demonstration be sure the beam is well away from eye level. The

beam should not be pointed at people or at shiny or reflective

surfaces.  

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whataero">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What are aerosols?</B></FONT></A>

 

<P>

Aerosols are particles suspended in air. They range in size from

a fraction of a micrometer to a few hundred micrometers. They

include smoke, bacteria, salt, pollen, dust, various pollutants

and tiny droplets of water. The scattering of light from aerosols

is called MIE SCATTERING.

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="whatms">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>What is Mie Scattering?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Aerosols are very efficient at scattering sunlight. Some

aerosols, especially black carbon particles created by fires,

efficiently absorb sunlight. You can easily observe Mie

scattering. Shine a bright flashlight or, even better, a red

laser beam across a dark room. The uniform glow you see that

outlines the beam of light is caused by Rayleigh scattering

(light scattered by molecules of air). Bright speckles in the

beam are caused by AEROSOLS (usually particles of dust) in the

air. This is Mie scattering. This demonstration can be made much

more dramatic by introducing chalk dust or smoke into the light

beam. Caution: If you use a laser for this demonstration be sure

the beam is well away from eye level. The beam should not be

pointed at people or at shiny or reflective surfaces.

<A NAME="howaccurate">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>How accurate are haze measurements made by the VHS-1?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

If the EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONSTANT measurement for your VHS-1 is

carefully made on a very clear day and if the LED, sunlight hole

and sunlight alignment target are all carefully aligned, then the

instrument should be able to make measurements which are

repeatable to within about 1% for identical sky conditions. For

best results, make haze measurements at mid-morning, noon and

mid-afternoon. You will probably find that the noon measurements

are not quite as repeatable as measurements made earlier and

later. 

<P><A HREF="">[back to top]</A></P>





<A NAME="willscientists">

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2><FONT COLOR="#93040E"><B>Will scientists be interested in my measurements?</B></FONT></A>



<P>

Yes. Comparatively few Sun photometers are in use around the

world. Since recent studies have shown that aerosols can block

considerable sunlight, thus causing a cooling effect on Earth's

climate, there is renewed interest in Sun photometer

measurements. Since the optical filters used to select specific

colors of sunlight degrade over time, scientists have been

mistrustful of measurements made by an earlier generation of Sun

photometers. The VHS-1 does not use a filter. Instead, it uses a

long-lived, highly stable LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE (LED) to detect a

narrow band of light wavelengths. This is the key advantage of

the VHS-1. Also, scientists are much more interested in results

using instruments that have been described in peer-reviewed

scientific journals. The VHS-1 meets this qualification. See

<A HREF="ref.html">REFERENCES</A>. Of course it is essential that you properly CALIBRATE

your instrument using the LANGLEY METHOD for its data be useful

to scientists.
