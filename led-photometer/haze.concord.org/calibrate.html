	<B>QUICK START!</B> You can begin using the TERC VHS-1 immediately without calibrating it. Just remember to record your

measurements and the date and time you made them in your

notebook. But eventually you must calibrate the instrument. You

can then insert all the data you previously collected into your

calibration formula.</MENU></TD>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><MENU>

	<P>

     All Sun photometers determine the clarity of the atmosphere,

and thus the blockage of direct sunlight caused by haze, smoke,

dust and smog, by measuring the intensity of sunlight. When

properly calibrated, different Sun photometers will give nearly

the same result.

<P>

     One way to calibrate a Sun photometer is to illuminate its

detector with light from a calibrated light source known as a

standard lamp. The problem with this approach is that calibrated

lamps cost hundreds of dollars. And they must be powered by very

stable power supplies that cost a few thousand dollars.

</P>

<P>

     Fortunately there's a free, highly stable standard lamp that

anyone can use. It's the Sun! Although sunlight varies slightly

in intensity during the solar cycle, for practical purposes, the

Sun can be considered a standard lamp. In fact, for more than a

century scientists have used the Sun to calibrate various kinds

of Sun photometers. 

</P>

<P>

     During the early 1900's, Samuel Langley and Charles Abbot of

the Smithsonian Institution perfected the method used to

calibrate Sun photometers that is still used today. The method is

named for Langley in honor of his pioneering work in this

important field.

</P>

<P>

     You can use the Langley method to calibrate a TERC VHS-1 so

that its accuracy is as good as a professional instrument costing

hundreds of dollars.

	<H2>Calibration Supplies</H2>

	<P>

     Be sure to collect all the necessary supplies BEFORE your

calibration session. Otherwise you may get off to a late start.

Before beginning, decide how you will measure the Sun's angle at

each measurement. You can use the TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet that

accompanies this manual. If you don't have access to a computer,

you can use one of the methods described in the <A HREF="appendix.html">Appendix</A>.

</P>



<P>

Here's a challenge: Measure the Sun's angle using the TERC VHS-1

spreadsheet and one or more of the methods described in the

Appendix. Then compare your results.

</P>



<P>

In addition to what you will need to measure the angle of the Sun

(see TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet or the <A HREF="appendix.html">Appendix</A>), here's what you

will need:

<B>An Important Note About Sun Safety...</B>



     You'll need to spend up to half a day in the Sun to

calibrate the TERC VHS-1. Half a day in the Sun can cause fair-skinned people to get a sun burn, so be sure to wear long sleeves

and rub sun screen on exposed skin if you are susceptible. No

matter what shade or color your skin is, be sure to wear a hat

and sunglasses to protect your eyes from the ultraviolet

radiation (UV-B) scattered from the sky. Skin color doesn't

matter when it comes to protecting your eyes from dangerous UV-B! 

<P>

<B>WARNING:</B> AVOID DAMAGE TO YOUR EYES! NEVER LOOK AT THE SUN, EVEN

WHILE WEARING SUNGLASSES! ALWAYS WEAR SUNGLASSES WHEN LOOKING AT

THE SKY!</P></TD></TR></TABLE>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><MENU>

	     You will need to make observations over a wide range of Sun

angles to calibrate the TERC VHS-1. This is the same method

pioneered by Samuel Langley nearly a century ago. For best

results, begin early in the morning and make measurements until

the Sun reaches the highest point in the sky. Or begin when the

Sun is at its highest point and measure until evening. If you

have a full day, making measurements all day will give you two

calibrations.

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">



<LI>Select a day when the sky is blue with few or no clouds.



<LI>Calibrate your watch against the time signals broadcast by

radio station WWV at the frequencies of 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz.



<LI>Before each calibration measurement it's important to check

the sky to make sure no clouds or cloud haze cover the Sun. Block

the Sun with a book or other opaque object held at arm's length

and look for nearby clouds or cloud haze.</OL></MENU></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#FFFFAA"><MENU>

<B>WARNING:</B> ALWAYS WEAR SUNGLASSES WHEN LOOKING AT THE SKY! NEVER

LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN EVEN IF YOU ARE WEARING SUNGLASSES!</MENU></TD></TR>

<TR>



	<TD VALIGN=TOP><MENU>

<OL TYPE="1" START="4">

<LI>Switch the TERC VHS-1 switch to the ON position, press the Sun

port on the instrument against a dark object (black paper or your

clothing) and write the number displayed by the voltmeter in the

third of four columns in your notebook. This number is known as

your instrument's dark signal. You must measure it each time you

measure the Sun.



<LI>Carefully point the VHS-1 at the Sun by centering the bright

circle of light that passes through the upper angle bracket

directly over the Sun target. While holding the VHS-1 as steady

as possible, read the voltage indicated on the voltmeter. The

numbers on the voltmeter display will flicker up and down. For

best results, pick the highest number that appears when the unit

is pointed directly at the Sun. This number is called the Sun

signal. Write the Sun signal in the third column in your notebook

and the exact time in the first column. Here is a sample notebook

entry for the prototype TERC VHS-1 from 17 March 1996. 



<pre>

     Time           Dark           Sun         Sky

                    Signal         Signal      Condition





     012:47:40      0.235          3.12        Clear

</pre>





<LI>If you plan to determine the Sun's angle using one of the

manual methods described in the <A HREF="appendix.html">Appendix</A>, try to make your Sun

angle and VHS-1 measurements as close together as possible.

Ideally, one student should make the VHS-1 measurements and

another the Sun angle measurements while a third student records

the data in the notebook.



<LI>Space your measurements 15-20 minutes apart when the Sun is

high in the sky. As the Sun rises (or descends), make the

observations more frequently. <P>

<A HREF="spbuildfig5.html">Figure 5</A> shows how the Sun's angle over the

horizon changes much faster in the early morning and late

afternoon than at midday.

</OL></MENU></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#FFFFAA"><MENU>

<B>PLAN AHEAD!</B> Before its time to

increase the number of measurements, be sure you have something

to drink and maybe some snacks. Use the rest room before

beginning your rapid series; there won't be time during the

actual measurements!

</MENU></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><MENU>

<OL TYPE="1" START="8">

   

<LI>Before ending your calibration session, review your notes to

make sure everything is legible and complete. Do not guess any

times you may have forgotten to record! Instead, don't use any

data when you don't know the time it was measured. Write a brief

summary about the sky conditions during the measurement time.

When you are satisfied that your notes are complete, you and any

others who helped should sign and date the notebook.</OL>
