	     After you collect all the necessary parts and tools (<A HREF="spbuildparts.html">see

Parts List</A>), you should be able to assemble the TERC VHS-1 Sun

Photometer in a few hours or less. If you have previous

experience building electronic circuits or kits, you may want to

make modifications to the instrument. This is acceptable only if

the distance between the roughened end of the LED and the

sunlight port in the case is 6.5 cm and the diameter of the

sunlight port is 7.0 mm.

	<B>IMPORTANT:</B> Be sure to collect all the necessary supplies and

tools before starting. Place all the parts in a box so you will

not lose any of them during assembly.

	 The instructions given here apply to the specific video case

described in the Parts List and illustrated in the drilling guide

shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig2.html">Fig. 2</A>. Other cases will also work if they are not too

flimsy. But you may need to alter the position of the batteries

and other items. Just be sure that the distance from the

roughened end of the LED to the hole in the case and the diameter

of the hole remain exactly 6.5 cm and 7.0 mm, respectively.<P>



Check off each step as you proceed. And avoid mistakes by taking

time to double check your work, especially BEFORE making holes. 

	</TD>





	<TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#FFFFAA"><MENU>

	<B>CAUTION:</B> Use appropriate safety procedures when drilling holes!

Be sure to place the case over a wood block before drilling

(unless you use a drill press with a hole for the drill to pass

through). Hold the case SECURELY when drilling or it will spin.

Although a drill is best, since the VHS case is very soft, holes

can be formed with a sharp hobby knife. These knifes are VERY

sharp! Use great care when making holes with a hobby knife! Avoid

applying too much pressure or the knife blade may snap off!

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">

<LI>Refer to <A HREF="spbuildfig2.html">Fig. 2</A> and place the solderless breadboard inside the

case as shown. Place one end of the solderless breadboard flush

against the inside of the rigid side of the case. Slide the

breadboard along the inside of the case until its upper side is

exactly 7 cm from the inside of the front end of the case.   

<LI>When the breadboard is in the proper position, hold it

securely and twirl a 3/32-inch drill bit in each of the four

holes to mark drill guides in the bottom of the case. Check to

make sure the breadboard was in the proper position.

<LI>Remove the breadboard and drill a 1/8-inch hole at each of the

four drill guides. Hold the case firmly while drilling. Don't

worry about plastic shavings that remain attached to the case.

We'll remove them later.

<LI>Close the case for this and the following steps. The upper

side of the case is the lid. Orient the case so the lid opens to

the LEFT. This means that the flexible side of the case is to the

left and the rigid side of the case is to the right. With the

case oriented like this, place a piece of masking tape on the

upper end of the lid to indicate the upper end of the case. 

<LI>With the case closed, use a small drill bit or scribe to mark

drill guides in the center of the flexible side of the case 4 cm

from the top and bottom edges.

<LI>With the case closed, use a 5/32-inch bit or its metric

equivalent to drill a hole at each of the two drill guides you

just marked. Hold the case firmly while drilling. The plastic

case is very soft, so drilling is easy. (Don't worry about

plastic shavings that remain attached to the case. We'll remove

them later.)

<LI>Place an angle bracket along the rigid side of the top end of

the case (<A HREF="spbuildfig3.html">see Fig. 3</A>). With the bracket held flush against the

shoulder extending from the bottom of the case, use the hole in

the bracket as a template to mark a drill guide. The hole will be

around 16 mm from the top end of the case.

<LI>Repeat this procedure to make a second drill guide in the

rigid side of the case 6.5 cm from the bottom end of the case

(<A HREF="spbuildfig3.html">see Fig. 3</A>).

<LI>With the case closed, use an angle bracket to check the

position of both drill guides. It is VERY important that the side

of the bracket is flush with the lower edge of the case as shown

in <A HREF="spbuildfig3.html">Fig. 3</A>. This will keep the bracket from moving after you attach it to the case. 

<LI>Use a 5/32-inch bit or its metric equivalent to drill holes

at the two previously marked drill guides.

<LI>Mark drill guides centered 1.8 and 4.5 cm from the bottom end

of the rigid side of the case.

<LI>With the case closed, use a 5/16-inch drill bit or its metric

equivalent to drill holes at the two previously marked guides.

Hold the case firmly while drilling.

<LI>Mark a single drill guide in the center of the bottom side of

the case (<A HREF="spbuildfig2.html">Fig. 2</A>). Check to make sure you marked the guide on

the bottom end, not the top end, of the case.

<LI>With the case closed, use a 15/32-inch (best choice) or a

1/2-inch bit or its metric equivalent to drill a hole at the

previously marked guide. Hold the case firmly while drilling.

<LI>Carefully remove any plastic that remains attached to the

edges of any of the holes. A sharp hobby knife may be necessary.<P>



<B>CAUTION:</B> Use care when using a knife to cut away any remaining

plastic!<P>

<I>Note: Two more holes will be drilled later.</I>
