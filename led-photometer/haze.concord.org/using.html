<H2>Using the TERC VHS-1</H2>

<P>

     You can use the TERC VHS-1 to find out how the AOT changes

over a day, week, season or even an entire year. If you follow

the instructions in this manual and use care in making your

measurements, the data you collect will have important scientific

value. Therefore, you might want to consider using the TERC VHS-1

in a serious science fair project or just a long-term

environmental monitoring project. You can even exchange data with

other students via the Internet to find out how haze changes in

other regions.  

</P>

<P>

     <B>Here are some important operator tips:</B>

</P



<OL TYPE="1" START="1">

<LI>WARNING: ALWAYS WEAR SUNGLASSES WHEN LOOKING AT THE SKY! NEVER

LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN EVEN WHEN WEARING SUNGLASSES! Looking at

the Sun may cause temporary or even permanent damage to your

vision.

<P>

<LI>If you want to study the AOT over time, try to make your

measurement at about the same time every day. Good choices are

mid-morning, noon and mid-afternoon. If you make three or more

measurements during the day, you will be able to see the changes

that often occur as the day warms or when the weather changes.

<P>

<LI>Always enter in your notebook the date, time of measurement,

dark signal, Sun signal and sky condition at the time of the

measurement. It's especially important to describe any clouds or

cloud haze in the vicinity of the Sun that might increase the

AOT.  

<P>

<LI>If you can't take your notebook with you for some reason,

stick a removable label on the TERC VHS-1 before you go out to

measure the Sun. You can write the time and the measurements on

the label for transfer to your notebook.

<P>

<LI>Try to process your data to recover the AOT as soon as you

can. If the AOT is especially low or high, you may want to make

more measurements.

<P>

<LI>Use graph paper or a computer to make a running graph (known

as a time series) of your AOT measurements from about the same

time every day.

<P>

<LI>Always save your raw data (date, time, dark signal and

sunlight signal). TERC plans to carefully test and evaluate the

various formulas and spreadsheets used to convert your readings

into AOT. Should we find ways to improve the formulas, we will

publish them so you can update your results. 

<P>

<LI>Finally, store your notebook in a safe place and backup any

data you enter into a computer! You have worked hard to obtain

your data, and you don't want to lose it! If you are a careful

Sun photometer user, your data will provide a very important

addition to knowledge about haze in your area. It is quite

possible that other students and even professional scientists

will want to study your data. </OL> </MENU></TD></TR></TABLE>
