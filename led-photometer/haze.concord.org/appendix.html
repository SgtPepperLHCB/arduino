<H2>APPENDIX: Measuring the Sun's Angle</H2>



<P>

     Every Sun photometer measurement must be accompanied by a

measurement of the Sun's angle above the horizon. You can measure

this angle using TERC VHS-1 software and a computer. Or You can

measure it directly using one of the methods described here.

</P>



<P>

     Why is it important to know the Sun's angle? As the Earth

rotates, the Sun appears to move across the sky. This means that

light from the Sun travels through less atmosphere when the Sun

is high in the sky than when it is low in the sky.

</P>



<P>

     When the Sun is straight overhead (as it is twice each year

if you live in Hawaii), its rays travel through one thickness of

atmosphere or one air mass (m). When the Sun is closer to the

horizon, its rays pass through more atmosphere than when the Sun

is straight overhead. Thus m increases as the Sun moves closer to

the horizon. The m for each of your measurements is 1 divided by

the sine of the Sun's angle (<) above the horizon or m = 1/sun<.

</P>



 

<H3>Determining the Sun's Angle</H3>



<P>

     You will need to know the angle of the sun above the horizon

to compute the air mass. You can determine this angle using the

shadow method, a digital level, a spreadsheet formula or by using

various software programs. The TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet can assist you in your calculations, and can be downloaded from: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/">ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/</A>If you measure the angle of the Sun

directly, be sure to do so immediately after making the

observations. In any case, it's very important to record the date

and the exact time of your observations. The time information

will permit you or others calculate the Sun's angle using a

computer spreadsheet at a later date should you or they elect to

do so.

</P>





<H3>A. Shadow Method</H3>



<P>

      You can measure the angle of the Sun to within about 1

degree or so by using the TERC VHS-1 as a simple sun dial. You'll

need a bubble level vial (also known as a spirit level) like

those used in a carpenter's level. Follow these steps:

</P>



<OL TYPE="1" START="1">

<LI>Cement the bubble level to the side of the VHS case adjacent

to the Sun Target angle bracket (see <A HREF="spbuildfig14.html">Fig. 14</A>). The bubble vial

should rest along the corner formed by the side of the case and

the angle bracket.



<LI>Cut a strip from a self-adhesive label measuring 8 cm long and

about 1 cm or so wide. Make a ruler by carefully placing lines

across the strip at 1 mm intervals. Number each tenth line (1, 2,

3, etc.).



<LI>Attach the self-adhesive ruler you have made to the side of

the VHS case between the two angle brackets as shown in Fig. 14.

The first line on the ruler should fall in line with the front

surface of the Sun Target.



<LI>To measure the Sun's angle over the horizon, place the TERC

VHS-1 on its side with the toggle switch pointed toward the sun.

Tilt the instrument until the bubble is centered.



<LI>Notice how the Sun Target casts a shadow along the ruler. When

the bubble is centered, measure the length of the shadow cast by

the Sun Target.



<LI>Record the length of the shadow, the date and the exact time

of your measurement in your notebook.



<LI>The tangent of the sun's angle above the horizon is the length

of the upper vane divided by the length of the vane's shadow. Use

a calculator to find the tangent of the angle.



<LI>When the tangent is displayed in the calculator's readout,

press the cotangent (TAN^-1) key to find the Sun's angle in

degrees above the horizon. Enter the angle in the notebook. </OL>





<H3>B. Inclinometer or Digital Level Method</H3>



<P>

     An inclinometer is a protractor with a weighted needle or

dial. When the base of the inclinometer is level, its indicating

needle or dial points straight up (90 degrees). When the

inclinometer is tilted, the needle or dial remains stable, thus

indicating the degrees of tilt. SmartLevel and other digital

carpenter's levels can also be used to find the Sun's angle.

</P>



<P>

     Since there are many different kinds of inclinometers and

digital levels, we can't provide detailed instructions on how to

use each of them. One method is to attach a straight hollow rod

along the base of the level. A small piece of paper should be

mounted near and in line with the end of the rod away from the

Sun. The base of the inclinometer or level is tilted toward the

Sun until a beam of sunlight emerges from the end of the rod and

forms a bright circle on the paper. The instrument is pointed

directly at the Sun, and the angle on the dial or readout

indicates the Sun's angle above the horizon.

</P>



<P>

     Digital levels work best and are more accurate, but they are

more expensive. Since the pointer or dial of a mechanical

inclinometer sometimes sticks, it might be necessary to tap the

instrument when it is at the desired angle.

</P>



 

<H3>C. Commercial Computer Programs</H3>



<P>

     <A HREF="ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/">The TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet</A> provides the Sun's angle and the

air mass for any location on any day and time. Various computer

programs are available that give the angle of the sun for any

time on any day of the year for any location on Earth. Examples

of such programs include AstroCalcTM and AstroCalc PlusTM (Zephyr

Services, 1900 Murray Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15217

USA). SunTimes, also available from Zephyr Services, gives the

angle of the Sun at solar noon and at 30-minute intervals for any

day and any location you specify.

</P>





<H3>Finding Local Time</H3>



<P>

     Solar noon for your location is not necessarily when your

watch shows 12:00, especially if daylight savings time is in

effect. Complete details about how to determine the local time

for your location are given in various books and magazines about

astronomy and sundial making.

</P>



<P>

     Briefly, the Earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours. This is

equivalent to 1 degree in 4 minutes or 15 degrees in one hour.

The standard time longitudes or meridians range from 45 to 165

degrees west in increments of 15 degrees. Therefore, the time at

each meridian is one hour earlier than the previous meridian. 

</P>



<P>

     To find your local time, first find the distance in degrees

between your longitude and your time meridian. Multiply the

number of degrees by four to obtain the correction for your

location. If you are east of the time meridian, add the

correction to the standard time for your area; if you are west of

the meridian, subtract the correction from the standard time. The

result is known as your local mean time.

</P>



<P>

     For example, the longitude for Omaha, Nebraska, is 96

degrees, 6 degrees west of the standard time meridian of 90

degrees. This means the time correction is 6 x 4 or 24 minutes.

Since Omaha is west of the meridian, 24 minutes must be

subtracted from Central Standard Time to arrive at the local mean

time for Omaha.

</P>



<P>

     Over the course of a year, the Earth's orbit causes the sun

to run either ahead of or behind local mean time by as much as 16

minutes. The actual difference between local mean time and the

actual or apparent time is called the equation of time. Computer

programs that compute the sun's angle, such as the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/">TERC VHS-1

spreadsheet</A>, automatically determine and correct for the equation

of time. For additional information, see <A HREF="going.html">Further Reading</A>.
