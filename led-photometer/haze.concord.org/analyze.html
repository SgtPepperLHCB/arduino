<H2>Analyzing Your Calibration data</H2>



<P>

     You will use the data from your Langley test to find what's

called the extraterrestrial constant, the signal the TERC VHS-1

would give at the top of the atmosphere (<A HREF="ref.html#4">4</A>). In other words, if

you took the TERC VHS-1 along on a trip into Earth orbit in the

Space Shuttle, the signal you would measure using the TERC VHS-1

during a space walk should be very close to what you measure on

the ground using the Langley method. 

</P>

<P>

     There are several ways to analyze your data to find the

extraterrestrial or ET constant, all of which should yield the

same result. After you find your instrument's ET constant, you

will insert it in a formula that will give you a standardized

measurement of haze known as aerosol optical thickness (AOT).  

</P>

<P>

     When you made your Langley measurements for a range of Sun

angles, each time the angle changed the thickness of the

atmosphere (the air mass) between you and the Sun changed (see

<A HREF="spbuildfig6.html">Fig. 6</A>.). When the Sun is straight overhead, its light passes

through one thickness of atmosphere or one air mass. The air mass

(m) increases as the Sun moves closer to the horizon. The m for

each of your measurements is 1 divided by the sine of the Sun's

angle (<) above the horizon or m = 1/sun<.

</P>

<P>

     If you make a graph of the natural logarithm (ln) of the

signal you measured versus m when you made the measurement, the

data points should fall along a straight line out to an m of 10

or so, assuming the sky conditions were stable during your

measurement period. If you extend the straight line, the ET

constant will be where the line crosses the air mass axis at m =

0. When m = 0, there is no air mass, which means this is the

signal the TERC VHS-1 will give if you could take it to the top

of the atmosphere.

</P>

<P>

     Several methods are available for extracting the ET constant

from your Langley test data. They should all give similar or

nearly identical results. All three methods perform what is

called a linear regression on your data. Briefly, a linear

regression fits the equation for a straight line, in this case,

ln of signal = a + (b x air mass), to your data. You then use

this equation to find the signal for m = 0.

</P>

<P>

     The first two methods require that you determine the air

mass for each measurement. The TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet does this

automatically, and can be downloaded from: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/">ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/</A> The methods given in the <A HREF="appendix.html">Appendix</A> require that you

use a calculator to convert the Sun angles to the respective air

masses. The air mass is the reciprocal of the Sun's angle above

the horizon, so enter the angle and press the SIN key. Then press

the 1/x key to get the air mass.

</P>





<H3>A. Graph Paper Method</H3>





<OL TYPE="1" START="1">

<LI>Make a table of the TERC VHS-1 measurements for a range of air

masses up to about 10. The first column should be the air mass

(m) for each measurement and the second column the Sun signal -

the dark signal.



<LI>Add a third column to your table for the natural logarithm

(ln) of the signal. (Use a scientific calculator with a ln key.) 



<LI>Print this title on the abscissa (x or horizontal axis) of the

graph: Air mass (m). 



<LI>Print this title on the ordinate (y or vertical axis) of the

graph: ln of signal.



<LI>Label the major divisions of the abscissa 0 to 10, as shown in

<A HREF="spbuildfig7.html">Fig. 7</A>. 



<LI>Plot the pairs of data in the first and third columns on your

table on the graph. 



<LI>Use a straight edge to draw a line through the center of the

points. Extend the line to the ordinate as shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig7.html">Fig. 7</A>.



<LI>The ET constant is where the line crosses the ordinate. Find

the value at this point and write it on your graph as you will

need it for the haze formula. The ET value derived from the hand

drawn graph in <A HREF="spbuildfig7.html">Fig. 7</A> is based on the first Langley test made

with a prototype TERC VHS-1. The ET constant is 1.292, which is

very close to the values given by the calculator and a computer

program.</OL>





<H3>B. Scientific Calculator Method</H3>

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">

<LI>Make a table of the TERC VHS-1 measurements for a range of air

masses up to about 10. The first column should be the air mass

(m) for each measurement and the second column the Sun signal -

the dark signal.



<LI>Add a third column to your table for the natural logarithm

(ln) of the signal. (Use a scientific calculator with a ln key.) 



<LI>Enter the data pairs into a scientific calculator capable of

performing a linear regression.



<LI>Insert the coefficients given by the calculator to calculate

the ln of the signal when m = 0. This number is the ET constant,

so write it on your table. The ET constant for the prototype TERC

VHS-1 is 1.2946.</OL>





<H3>C. Computer Spreadsheet Method </H3>



<P>

     The TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet program (<A HREF="ref.html#5">5</A>) automatically

determines the air mass for each data point. You can then use a

scientific calculator, the spreadsheet's regression function or

curve-fitting software to find the formula for the best fit

through the points. The TERC VHS-1 spreadsheet can be downloaded from: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/">ftp://ftp.concord.org/pub/haze/vhs1-download/</A>

</P>

<P>

     <A HREF="spbuildfig8.html">Fig. 8</A> shows a computer-generated graph of the all the data

from the first Langley test of a TERC VHS-1. Notice how the data

begin to curve when the air mass exceeds about 10? This

established that the upper air mass limit for this instrument is

m = 10. <A HREF="spbuildfig9.html">Fig. 9</A> shows a second computer-generated graph for only

the data up to m = 10. Notice how the points appear to form a

straight line?

</P>

<P>

     <A HREF="spbuildfig10.html">Figure 10</A> shows that the points in <A HREF="spbuildfig9.html">Fig. 9</A> form a very

straight line indeed. This graph was made with a powerful curve-fitting program called TableCurve (Jandel Scientific). In only

seconds, this program fitted the data to hundreds of mathematical

functions. It then drew the graph in <A HREF="spbuildfig10.html">Fig. 10</A> for the straight

line formula (y = a + bx). The program also gave the coefficients

for the formula and the value of the Sun signal for m = 0 (the ET

constant). The ET constant for the prototype TERC VHS-1 is

1.2946, the same number provided a little more slowly by a

standard scientific calculator using the same data.
