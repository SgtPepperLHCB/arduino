<P>

	Two different sizes of screws and hex nuts are used. The 6-32

screws are thicker than the 4-40 screws.

</P>

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">

<LI>Use four 4-40 screws and hex nuts to mount the solderless

breadboard inside the case as shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig4.html">Fig. 4</A>. The rows and

columns of holes in the breadboard are numbered. Align the

breadboard so that column number 1 is closest to the rigid side

of the case. Insert the screws through the bottom side of the

case. Tighten the screws and hex nuts with a screw driver and

pliers.

<LI>Use a file to remove 1 mm from the end of an angle bracket.

Mark the filed end with a colored marker or pencil.

<LI>Place the angle bracket in front of the breadboard as shown in

<A HREF="spbuildfig4.html">Fig. 4</A>. Adjust the bracket until it is 2.25 cm from the inside of

the rigid side of the case. The holes in the bracket will then be

aligned with columns 2 and 3 of the breadboard.

<LI>With the bracket pushed flush against the breadboard, mark a

drill guide in the bottom of the VHS case at the center of the

hole in the bracket.

<LI>Use a 5/32-inch bit or its metric equivalent to drill a hole

at the drill guide you just marked. Hold the case firmly while

drilling. Carefully use a hobby knife to remove any plastic

attached to the edge of the hole. 

<LI>Insert a 6-32 screw through the back side of the case and the

hole in the unfiled end of the angle bracket. Place a 6-32 hex

nut over the screw.

<LI>Make sure the filed end of the angle bracket faces up. Then

press the bracket flush against the breadboard and tighten the

screw and nut with a screw driver and pliers. 

<LI>Refer to <A HREF="spbuildfig2.html">Fig. 2</A> and measure the exact distance of the center

of the upper hole in the angle bracket from the inside of the

rigid side of the case (2.25 mm in the prototype) and the bottom

of the case (1.7 cm). Then mark a drill guide in the front of the

case that exactly matches these dimensions.

<LI>Double check the drill guide you just marked to make sure it

is centered directly over the hole in the angle bracket installed

inside the case. Then use a 9/32-inch bit to drill a hole at the

drill guide. If you don't have this drill bit, drill a smaller

hole and carefully enlarge it with a reamer or hobby knife.  

<LI>Install the two 9-volt battery clips on the inside of the

flexible side of the case using 6-32 screws and hex nuts at the

locations shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig4.html">Fig. 4</A>. Be sure to insert the screws through

the battery holders and then through the inside of the flexible

side of the case. Tighten the screws and hex nuts with a screw

driver and pliers.

<LI>Install two angle brackets on the outside of the case using

6-32 screws and hex nuts. Orient the brackets as shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig3.html">Fig. 3</A>.

Be sure the edges of these brackets are flush with the shoulder

that protrudes along the bottom edge of the case as shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig3.html">Fig. 3</A>. (If one or both brackets are not flush, enlarge the hole

slightly so the bracket can be pushed against the shoulder.) Make

sure the lid of the VHS case closes properly. Then tighten the

screws and hex nuts with a screw driver and pliers.

<LI>Remove the hex nuts and lock washers from the two binding

posts. Insert the threaded ends of each binding post into the

holes shown in <A HREF="spbuildfig4.html">Fig. 4</A>. Install the black binding post nearest the

end of the case. Replace the locking washers and hex nuts and

tighten with pliers.

<LI>Place the solderless breadboard over its mounting holes so

that the row of holes designated 1 is next to the rigid side of

the case. Insert 4 4-40 screws through the back of the case and

hold them in place with 4-40 hex nuts. Tighten the screws and hex

nuts with a screw driver and pliers. 



<LI>Stop for a moment to review what you have done so far. Are

the external angle brackets flush with the shoulder that extends

along the bottom of the case? Are all the hex nuts tightened?

Does the case close properly?
