<H2>Some Sample Sun Photometer Data</H2>



<P>

     <A HREF="spbuildfig11.html">Figure 11</A> shows the AOT measured by a Sun photometer since

the spring of 1990. This instrument is the first known Sun

photometer to use an LED as a detector. Notice how warm weather

haze causes the AOT in South Texas to rise in the summer. Cold

weather in this region often means very clear air, which causes

the AOT to reach very low values. The big bulge in AOT from the

fall of 1991 to the end of 1994 was caused by a thick cloud of

aerosols that formed high in the stratosphere after the eruption

of Mount Pinatubo on 15 June 1991.

</P>

<P>

     <A HREF="spbuildfig12.html">Figure 12</A> is a line graph which shows the AOT measurements

made by the prototype TERC VHS-1 from noon until evening at my

observing site in South Texas on 9 March 1996, a day when the sky

had a few cirrus clouds but was otherwise very clear. Notice that

the clarity of the atmosphere remained reasonably stable during

this time. On some days there can be significant changes in AOT.

The dip at 18:00 (6:00 p.m.) is caused by the error that occurs

when the air mass exceeds 10 or so.

</P>

<P>

     <A HREF="spbuildfig13.html">Figure 13</A> is a bar graph which shows the AOT measured by the

prototype TERC VHS-1 near solar noon during each of its first 8

days of testing. Even though only 8 days of data are shown in

<A HREF="spbuildfig13.html">Fig. 13</A>, this graph clearly shows how the arrival of cool, dry

air over South Texas caused relatively low AOTs on 9-11 March.

When warmer, more humid air returned to South Texas on 12 March,

the AOT increased sharply. On 14 and 15 March, wispy cloud haze

boosted the AOT even higher. A cool front brought in dry air on

17 March. Although the AOT fell sharply, it was higher than the

earlier lows. The question was what caused this? A gigantic grass

fire brought on by very dry conditions produced considerable

smoke over Central Texas. Apparently the cool front arriving from

the north blew some of this smoke over my site, thus increasing

the AOT above what it should have been. 

</P>

<P>

     A powerful cold front with very strong winds is blowing

through South Texas as this manual is completed the morning of 18

March. Will the AOT at solar noon be lower than on 17 March when

thin smoke drifted high overhead? Not necessarily. The absence of

rain that has provoked grass fires has also allowed the soil to

dry, and the weather forecast predicts blowing dust to arrive

from North Texas. Already there is a thin film of dust on exposed

glass windows outdoors. Exactly how this dust will affect the AOT

remains to be seen, but it will certainly have an effect!

</P>

<P>

     Incidentally, as some sharp-eyed readers have probably

noticed by now, the AOT in Figs. 12 and 13 is generally higher

than in <A HREF="spbuildfig11.html">Fig. 11</A> for the same time of the year. This is because

AOT increases as wavelength decreases. The TERC VHS-1 detects

green light (about 525 nm), and the instrument used to collect

the data in <A HREF="spbuildfig11.html">Fig. 11</A> detects near-infrared (about 850 nm). This

means that an annual graph of AOT data made with the TERC VHS-1

will be less distinct (fuzzier or, as a scientist might say,

noisier) than a graph of data collected in the near-infrared. But

the TERC VHS-1 graph will closely reflect what your eye actually

sees. And it will more closely indicate the effect of haze on

direct sunlight near the peak of the sunlight spectrum.

</P>

<P>

     As you can see, considerable information can be gleaned from

AOT data--especially when the weather is changing, if a major

volcano eruption occurs or if you are near significant sources of

air pollution. What will your measurements show?
