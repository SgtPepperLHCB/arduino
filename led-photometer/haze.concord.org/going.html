<H2>Going Further</H2>



<P>

     There are many ways to modify the TERC VHS-1. Just be sure

that the diameter of the sunlight port and its distance from the

LED have the same dimensions as those given in this manual.

</P>

<P>

     It's okay to use a Radio Shack printed circuit board instead

of a solderless breadboard. But you will need to solder the parts

and wires to the board. It's also possible to use a smaller

switch with solder, instead of screw, terminals. Soldering is

easy if you know what to do. See "Getting Started in Electronics" 

(Radio Shack, 1983) for simple soldering instructions and

information about electronic parts such as the operational

amplifier, LED and resistor used in the TERC VHS-1.    

</P>

<P>

     Finally, the solderless breadboard inside the TERC VHS-1 has

room for up to two additional amplifiers and LEDs. This means you

can expand the instrument to measure other wavelengths of light

by using different LEDs. You will need to provide a way to select

which amplifier is connected to the voltmeter.

</P>

     



<H2>Further Reading</H2>



<P>

     Many articles on haze have been published in magazines. See,

for example, "Lost Horizons" by Stephen F. Corfidi (Weatherwise,

12-17, June/July 1993); "The Parasol Effect" by David Berreby

(Discover, 44-50, July 1993); and "Haze Clouds the Greenhouse" by

Richard Monastersky (<I>Science News</I>, 141, 232-233, April 11, 1992). 

</P>

<P>

     Hundreds of papers on haze and its measurement have been

published in scientific journals. An especially good general

paper is "Haze and Sulfur Emission Trends in the Eastern United

States" by Rudolf B. Husar and William E. Wilson (<I>Environmental

Science Technology</I>, 27, 1, 12-16, 1993).

</P>

     Astronomer Robert G. Roosen has specialized in interpreting

old Sun photometer data collected by the Astrophysical

Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution at various sites

around the world from the early part of this century until the

1960's. See, for example, Dr. Roosen's classic paper, written

with Ronald J. Angione and Clara H. Klemcke, "Worldwide

Variations in Atmospheric Transmission: 1. Baseline Results from

Smithsonian Observations" (<I>Bulletin of the American

Meteorological Society</I>, 54, 4, 307-316, 1973).

</P>

<P>

     An excellent reference on haze in the United States is

"Acidic Deposition: State of Science and Technology, Report 24,

Visibility: Existing and Historical Conditions--Causes and

Effects," John C. Trijonis et al., U. S. Government Printing

Office, 1990.

</P>

<P>

     How Sun photometers on the ground are used to verify Sun

photometers in satellites is described by G. S. Kent, M. P.

McCormick and P. -H. Wang in "Validation of Stratospheric Aerosol

and Gas Experiments I and II satellite aerosol optical depth

measurements using surface radiometer data (<I>Journal of

Geophysical Research</I>, 99, D5, 10,333-10,340, 1994).      

</P>

<P>

     You can find more articles on haze by looking under the

keyword "haze" in various reference indexes at a library. 

</P>

<P>

     For more information on finding the local apparent time for

your location, see <I>The USA Today Weather Almanac</I> (Vintage

Books, 1995). You can also find information on this subject in

basic books about astronomy and sun dials.

</P>

<P>

     At the time of this writing, there is very little

information about haze on the Internet. Hopefully, your data will

someday appear there!
