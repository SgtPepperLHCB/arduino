<H3>THE PROBLEM: Why Measure Haze?<BR>



	-by Forrest M. Mims III</H3></A>

<P>	<IMG SRC="images/tj.gif" ALT="Thomas Jefferson sketch" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="65" BORDER="0">

		Thomas Jefferson loved to write about the mild climate of Virginia and its azure skies. Were he to return today, he would notice barely any difference



	in temperature, rain and snow. We know this because Jefferson kept very 



	detailed daily records of the weather at Monticello



	from 1810 to 1816. But he would notice a difference in the sky, which today



	is cloudier and hazier than in Jefferson's time.</P>



	When dust, smoke, pollen or tiny droplets of water float in the air,



	the sky becomes hazy. Outdoor photographers sometimes like haze because



	it diffuses sunlight, thus softening its glare. Some plants that grow in



	shady places like haze because it provides light they would otherwise not



	receive. <P>



	But haze also has other effects. Since haze scatters some sunlight back



	into space, many scientists think that increased haze over the Northern



	Hemisphere has caused a slight cooling effect. On a hazy summer day, people



	with light skin can receive a sunburn even when in the shade. This happens



	when most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation is received from the hazy sky



	instead of the direct sun. In some regions haze can be so thick that shadows



	are faint or even invisible. <P>

	Haze also obscures visibility. Over the past few decades, scenic vistas



	in many regions of the United States have been obscured by haze originating



	from air pollution created by large power plants and increased automobile



	traffic.<P>

<H3>WHY AMATEUR COLLABORATION?</H3></A>

<DL>

The advantage of using amateur scientists is that there are many more of us. 

Forrest finds that student and adult amateur scientists can do very high 

quality work. The bottom line is that there is no national or global 

haze monitoring network. The field is wide open, and amateurs can make 

a valuable contribution. Of course professional scientists can also 

participate. 

<P>

Amateur science has a long tradition of excellence,  Many famous

discoveries have been made by amateurs. Alexander Graham Bell was a 

teacher of the deaf, but he invented the first successful telephone 

and photophone. Michael Faraday never attended school, but he 

discovered fundamental principles of electricity. Some 40% of comets 

are discovered by amateur astronomers.</DL><P>



	<A NAME="approach"><HR SIZE=5 WIDTH=510 NOSHADE ALIGN=LEFT><H3>THE APPROACH:</H3></A>

	Sun photometers are ideal for monitoring natural haze and air 

	pollution by measuring the transmission of sunlight through the 

	atmosphere.  As a result of the haze or pollution, the atmospheric 

	optical thickness  is slightly increased when the sun is scattered by 

	molecules of air.  A sun photometer measures the sunlight in a narrow 

	spectral band that passes through the Earth's atmosphere.
