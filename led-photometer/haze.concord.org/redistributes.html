<H2>How Haze Redistributes Sunlight (or &quot;Why is the Sky Blue?&quot;)</H2>

There is no significant atmosphere on the moon.  So unless an astronaut



or meteor has kicked up some dust, there is no haze.  All the light from



the Sun arrives in a straight line from the Sun.  No sunlight arrives from



anywhere else in the sky.<BR>



<BR>



The atmosphere greatly changes the way sunlight reaches the surface of 



Earth.  Most of the light you can see comes directly from the Sun.  But



some is scattered around the sky by molecules of air (Rayleigh scattering)



and by the myriad of tiny particles or aerosols drifting in the air (Mie



scattering).  These particles or aerosols include water droplets. smoke,



salt, pollen, carbon, spider webs, bacteria, sulfates, plant matter, synthetic



fibers and dust (from soil and even volcanoes and meteors.)<BR>



<BR>



Rayleigh and Mie scattering control the way the sky appears.  Since molecules



of air are about the size of a wavelength of blue light, blue light is scattered



very efficiently by the atmosphere.  This is why the sky is often blue,



especially on a clear day after a cold front has passed by or during certain



times in the tropics.<BR>



<BR>



What happens to the blue when the sky is hazy?  While air molecules scatter



blue light best, aerosols and particles are so much larger scatter



all wavelengths of sunlight well.  This means that a sky full of aerosols



looks pale blue or even milky white.  Aerosols can be natural, as when water



forms on tiny particles of salt from the oceans.  Forest fires can cause



haze that covers many thousands of square kilometers.  Volcanic emissions



can also form a natural haze, as residents of the Big Island of Hawaii know



all too well.  And major volcano eruptions, like Mount Pinotubo in 1991,



can cause a blanket of haze to cover the entire Earth for several years



or more.<BR>



<BR>



Thick, milky white haze covers much of the Eastern United States, Europe



and parts of Asia during the hot months of summer.  Although some of this



haze is created when gases from trees react with sunlight, much of it is



caused by sulphates emitted by power plants that burn coal which contains



sulphur.  Up in the air the sulphate particles become coated with water,



which forms an aerosol that efficiently scatters visible wavelengths of



light.  Another down side of sulphate aerosols is that they are acidic and



contribute to acid rain and fog.<BR>



<BR>



When there is considerable pollution from gasoline engines, a layer of



brown smog may develop in the sky.  This layer contains nitrogen oxides



which absorb blue light and thus appear brown.<BR>
